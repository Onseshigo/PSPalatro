## <ins>Original Description:</ins> 
 
I did this for fun in whatever free time I managed to get.  
<ins>There is **no** roadmap and **no** plans for future updates, they may come or not, I will try to fix bugs whenever I can.</ins>
Not all implemented rules match the original game exactly, some of them I couldn't find information on (i.e. the probabilities of certain events).

### <ins>Features Implemented Now:</ins>
- Main in-game loop
- Shop (singles and boosters)
- Card enhancements
- Card editions
- 80+ Jokers
- Consumables **(except for spectral cards)**
- Full and remaining deck view
- Experimental background music implementation, works ok when overclock is enabled.
- Natural negative jokers

## **<ins>Build Instructions</ins>**

1. Install the PSPSDK (link [here](https://pspdev.github.io/pspsdk/))
2. Check if the following packages are installed for the PSPSDK (using for example psp-pacman):
    - `libzip`
    - `vorbis`
    - `liblzma`
    - `stb`
3. Run `make`

## **<ins>Run Instructions</ins>**

1. Copy `EBOOT.PBP` and the files in the `assets` folder to a folder for the game in your PSP.
2. Copy your official Balatro copy executable to that same folder.
3. Modify the `settings.ini` file (see below for details). `(optional)`

## <ins>Configuration</ins> (`settings.ini` file)

The `settings.ini` file can have the following entries:
- archive_file_name (string) - the name of Balatro executable
- hand_size (number) - initial hand size
- hands (number) - initial hands
- discards (number) - initial discards
- wealth (number) - initial wealth ($)
- joker_slots (number) - initial joker slots
- consumable_slots (number) - initial consumable slots
- shop_item_slots (number) - initial shop single slots
- shop_booster_slots (number) - initial shop booster slots
- audio (boolean) - turn audio on or off (it is advisable to use with overclock)
- move_cards (boolean) - turn card oscillation on or off
- overclock (boolean) - set the CPU and BUS clocks to 333Mhz, which I believe it to be fine for the PSP, it may however drain the battery faster
- ante_score_scaling (int) - how the ante score scales (values from 1 to 3)
- speed (int) - how fast scoring is (values from 1 to 5)
